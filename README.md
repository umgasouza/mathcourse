# Math Verify
This repository has the following objectives:
1. Be a quick and easy to use software
2. Solve a problem by pieces (this is related to verify my math)
3. Don't be very complex (the code should'nt use: classes, templates, memory management)
Note: The 3rd point in this README is related to how good the code is to show to begginers how C++ works.
